Some of my dotfiles - feel free to copy and modify them.

These dotfiles have been tested on OS X Mavericks, but might
also work in other operating systems with a few modifications.

For zsh I use:
    - oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
    - and vimpager: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1723

My vimrc requires:
    - vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
