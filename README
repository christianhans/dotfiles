These are some of my dotfiles. Feel free to copy and modify them.

The dotfiles have only been tested on Mac OS X Lion, but might
also work on other operating systems with a few modifications.

For zsh I use oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
and vimpager (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1723).
